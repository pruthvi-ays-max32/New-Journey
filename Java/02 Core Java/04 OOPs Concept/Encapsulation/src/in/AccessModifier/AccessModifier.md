## Access Modifier : (4 types)

# 1. Public -> It is accessible from anywhere.
# 2. Default -> It is accessible within the defined package.
# 3. Protected -> It is accessible within the defined class and subclass.
# 4. Private -> It is accessible within the defined Class.

# Class_level_Access : Class can be public or default.
# Member_level_Access : Methods, varibles, Constructors can be private, public, protected or default.

# NOTE : Always start coding with high restriction because it is easy to increase the access level but complicated to reduce the access level.

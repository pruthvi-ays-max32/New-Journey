# Getter And Setter : if we wanted to give access of private variable outside the class to update or retrive then we can use getter and setter methods.
- it can be public, protected or any access modifier.

# Getters: Retrieve pri ate field values, typically named get<FieldName>.
# Settprs: Set or updatg_prj-uate-field values, usually named set<FieldName>.
# Untrol and Validation: Offer controlled access and allow for validation logic.
# Encapsulation: Facilitate read-only or write-only access to class fields.
# Flexibility: Allow for internal changes without affecting external interfaces.

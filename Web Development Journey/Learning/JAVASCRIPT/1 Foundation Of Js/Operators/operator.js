    # Operators in Js

      Arithmetic Operator :                     
          +  -> Addition
          -  -> Subtraction
          *  -> Multiplication
          /  -> Division
          %  -> Modulo
          ** -> Power
          ++ -> increment
          -- -> decrement

      Comparison Operator :
          <     -> less than
          >     -> greater than
          <=    -> less than equal to
          >=    -> greater than equal to 
          ==    -> equal to   (it will check dtype and if not same then it will make it same and then compare and tell us.)
          !=    -> not equal to 
          ===   -> strict equal to (it checks data type first if similar then it will check for value.)

      Logical :
          &&   -> Logical AND
          ||   -> Logical OR
          !    -> Logical NOT



      # Template String

        Problems with normal string 
            1. can't be multi-Lined
            2. can't show the value of variable 
            3. can't call the function
        
        // normal String 

        let x = "Hello" + 3
        console.log(x)

        let y = 30
        let str = `Hello ${y}`
        console.log(str)

        it is not possible in normal string
        let str1 = `H
        E
        L
        L
        O`

        console.log(str1)

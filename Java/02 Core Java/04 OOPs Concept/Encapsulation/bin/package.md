# Package Definition: A package in Java is a namespace that organizes classes and interfaces, preventing naming conflicts.
# Package Declaration: Packages are declared at the beginning of a Java source file using the package keyword followed by the package name.
# Import Statement: An import statement in Java is used to bring in classes or interfaces from other packages into the current file, making them accessible without using a fully qualified name.

*** Types of Import ***
1. Single-Type Import: Imports a single class or interface from a package (e.g., import java.util.List;).
2. On-Demand Import: Imports all classes and interfaces from a package (e.g., import java.util.*;).

# Avoiding Collisions: Packages help in avoiding name collisions by categorizing similar classes together.
# Built-in Packages: Java comes with built-in packages like java.lang (automatically imported.) , java.io, java.util, etc.
# UserDefined Packages.

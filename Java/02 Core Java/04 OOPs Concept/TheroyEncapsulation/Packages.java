                    Encapsulation : When object only exposes the selected information.
                          - bind class properties and methods together. 
                          - Data Hiding -> It hides internal data, allowing access only through methods.
                          - Access Modifiers -> It uses Access Modifiers to control access to class members.
                          - Getter/Setter -> Provides public methods for controlled property. means-> we can't directly update/set values to class members we need to use getter and setter methods for it.
                          - Maintain Integrity -> Protects object state form external Interferences.
                          - Enhance Modularity -> Keep classes seperate and reduce coupling.
